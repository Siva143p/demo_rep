            <h2>Dragon</h2>
            <br>
            <p><span>A</span> dragon is a large magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of multiple cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have
                often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits
                are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian, mammal, and avian features. Scholars believe vast extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely
                the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.</p><br><br>

                <h2>Chinese Dragon</h2>
                <img src="/images/chinese-dragon.jpg" alt="">
                <p>long, (Chinese: “dragon”) Wade-Giles romanization lung, in Chinese mythology, a type of majestic beast that dwells in rivers, lakes, and oceans and roams the skies. Originally a rain divinity, the Chinese dragon, unlike its malevolent
                    European counterpart (see dragon), is associated with heavenly beneficence and fecundity. Rain rituals as early as the 6th century BCE involved a dragon image animated by a procession of dancers; similar dances are still practiced
                    in traditional Chinese communities to secure good fortune. <br><br>Ancient Chinese cosmogonists defined four types of dragons: the Celestial Dragon (Tianlong), who guards the heavenly dwellings of the gods; the Dragon of Hidden Treasure
                    (Fuzanglong); the Earth Dragon (Dilong), who controls the waterways; and the Spiritual Dragon (Shenlong), who controls the rain and winds. In popular belief only the latter two were significant; they were transformed into the Dragon
                    Kings (Longwang), gods who lived in the four oceans, delivered rain, and protected seafarers. <br><br>Generally depicted as a four-legged animal with a scaled, snakelike body, horns, claws, and large, demonic eyes, the long was considered
                    the king of animals, and his image was appropriated by Chinese emperors as a sacred symbol of imperial power.

                <img src="/images/408px-Summon_b_2030007000.png" alt="">
                <p>The wyvern (waIvərn or WY-vərn, sometimes spelled wivern) is a type of dragon with two legs, two wings, and often a pointed tail which is said to be a venomous stinger. <br><br>The wyvern in its various forms is important in heraldry,
                    frequently appearing as a mascot of schools and athletic teams (chiefly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). It is a popular creature in European literature, mythology, and folklore. Today, it is often used in fantasy
                    literature and video games. The wyvern in heraldry and folklore is rarely fire-breathing, unlike other dragons.

                <img src="/images/John_Bauer,_1911_(cropped,_no_signature).jpg" alt="">
                <p>The lindworm (worm meaning snake), also spelled lindwyrm or lindwurm, is a mythical creature in Northern and Central European folklore that traditionally has the shape of a giant serpent monster, living deep in the forest. It can be seen
                    as a sort of dragon.

                <h2>Fáfnir</h2>
                <img src="/images/Famous-Dragons-in-Norse-346x188.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Fafnir, in Nordic mythology, name of the great dragon slain by Sigurd, the Norse version of the German hero Siegfried. As told in the Völsunga saga (“Saga of the Volsungs”), Fafnir slew his father, Hreithmar, to obtain the vast amount
                    of gold which Hreithmar had demanded of Odin as a compensation for the loss of one of his sons. Odin gave the gold but put a curse on it. Full of greed, Fafnir changed into a dragon to guard his treasure and was later slain by the
                    young hero Sigurd. Sigurd was spurred on by another brother of Fafnir, the blacksmith Regin. Once Sigurd, under the advice of Odin, had killed Fafnir, Regin asked him to cook the dragon’s heart for him.</p>

                <img src="/images/HD-wallpaper-sea-serpent-serpent-abstract-sea-creature.jpg" alt="">
                <p>sea serpent, mythological and legendary marine animal that traditionally resembles an enormous snake. The belief in huge creatures that inhabited the deep was widespread throughout the ancient world. In the Old Testament there are several
                    allusions to a primordial combat between God and a monstrous adversary variously named Leviathan or Rahab.</p>

            <p>"For using dragon's bones, first cook odorous plants; bathe the bones twice in hot water, pound them to powder and put this in bags of gauze. Take a couple of young swallows and, after taking out their intestines and stomach, put the bags
                in the swallows and hang them over a well. After one night take the bags out of the swallows, rub the powder and mix it into medicines for strengthening the kidneys. The efficacy of such a medicine is as it were divine!"<br><span class="an">--Chinese medical scholar Lei Xiao (AD 420-477)</span>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Mortal Enemies</h2>
            <p>According to the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder (AD 23-79), a dragon could strangle an elephant with its tail. Perhaps Pliny heard stories about pythons, which can crush and devour large animals, though elephants are beyond their capabilities.</p><br>
            <h2>So They Say</h2>
            <p>"The dragons of the mountains have scales of a golden color, and in length excel those of the plain, and they have bushy beards, which also are of a golden hue; and their eye is sunk deep under the eyebrow, and emits a terrible and ruthless
                glance."
                <br><span class="an">--Greek scholar Philostratus (c. AD 170-245)</span> </p><br>
            <h2>Dragon Bones</h2>
            <p>In traditional Chinese medicine, longgu, or "dragon bones," are prescribed as a treatment for numerous ailments, from madness to diarrhea and dysentery. Most fragments and powders sold in Chinese pharmacies as dragon bone come from fossil
                remains of extinct mammals, unearthed from China's renowned fossil </p><br>
            <h2>Dragon's Blood</h2>
            <p>Arab merchants once sailed to the Socotra Islands in the Arabian Sea to obtain resin from the fruit of the palmlike dragon's blood tree. Dragon's blood was once prized as a medicine in Europe and the Middle East. According to the early Roman
                naturalist Pliny the Elder, it formed when dragons attacked elephants, and their blood ran together and congealed.</p><br>
            <h2>"Dragon" Skull</h2>
            <p>The skull of a woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) was once kept in the town hall of Klagenfurt, Austria. It was said to be the remains of a dragon slain before the city was founded around AD 1250.</p><br>
